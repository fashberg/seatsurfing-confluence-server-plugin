# Confluence Server & Datacenter Plugin for Seatsurfing

This is the Confluence Server and Datacenter Plugin for Seatsurfing built with the Atlassian Plugin SDK.

The plugin basically renders an iFrame and loads the Seatsurfing Booking UI from the configured URL. In order to ensure that the backend knows which user is using Atlassian Confluence, this Confluence App encodes the information about the current user using a symmetrically encoded JWT passed to the configured backend.
